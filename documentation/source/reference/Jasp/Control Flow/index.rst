Hybrid Control Flow
===================

Due to the Jax embedding, jasp comes with a matured ecosystem for representing classical computations. To enable a fully hybrid software stack, we need the ability to perform quantum computations based on the results of classical conditions. For this we provide two interfaces in particular.
