Quantum computers are associated with the hope of achieving enormous leaps in computing power. However, only a few people have been able to use them to date, as their programming poses entirely new challenges. In addition, the limited number of developers in the field has made effective collaboration difficult. Based on our experience developing and disseminating Qrisp, we learned that quantum software development attracts considerable interest but people have a hard time to start writing code beyond reproducing tutorials. Additionally industrial software developers and decision makers rarely have the means to get a realistic overview over what kind of problems can be tackled using quantum computers.

This will change with the Thinq Qrisp Community!
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
The offical Thinq-Qrisp website [REF]

The community will offer a platform where developers can work on new ideas for programming quantum computers. Newly developed technologies will be quickly integrated into the open-source project Qrisp. The Thinq Qrisp Community is the central meeting place for all those who want to engage in quantum and pull it from the realm of abstract science into application oriented software development. For this we want to bundle and network the activities of the quantum software engineering community.

**The Thinq Qrisp community facilitates exchange between industry, academia and newcomers!**

Planned activities
''''''''''''''''''

On the 12th of Febuary we will have a new free webinar, which will revolve around the integration of `JAX <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html>`_ in Qrisp. We will introduce you to our high-performance module **Jasp**, which leaverages the compilation speed-ups of JAX.
