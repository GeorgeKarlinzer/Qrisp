for aqt benchmarking check (qubits, gates)
CHEck if they meet reqs, if not see if they can be reduced 


tsp (4 nodes) -- NOT WORKS / 4 nodes Needs 23 qubits
sat_solver -- works ?? 10, 2700?
QUBO -- works / 4, 50, can be push up to 20nodes, 700 gates (depth 5)
division -- NOT works / q_divmod works 21, 664 / q_div example reqs 38 , 2838 / q_inv 49, 3650
arithmetic -- works / 17, 702 min_reqs are dependend on precision of calcs, example is max of what is possible
QAOA MaxCut -- works / 4,24 can be push up to 20nodes, 700 gates (depth 5)
backtracking -- works / 40??, 501 min_reqs are dependend on on complexity and depth, example is max of what is possible

QUBIT numbers up for discussion, might be ssmaller due to Memory Management optimization
gate number may also be smaller, due to inseperability of quantumsession objects
