"""
This class entails example usage of Fourier heuristic for QAOA Problems, which are used for finding 
good starting parameters for regular graph MaxCut QAOA problems. For further details, see the implementation, 
mainly the class `fourier_optimization_wrapper`.

The general idea is to exploit the energy landscape of regular graph QAOA optimizations w.r.t. the parameterization.
The optimization curve for these parameters in such problem instances is "rather smooth". Therefore, a discrete sine/cosine 
transformation of the parameters is effective. This also lowers the number of parameters to be optimized, 
if fourier_depth < (original) depth. For more details, see the paper below. 

The original implementation stems from the paper 
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01041.pdf 
by L. Zheo et al.
